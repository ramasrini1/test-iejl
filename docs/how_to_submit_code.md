# How to Submit Your Code

First of all, Github is _not_ git. Many people understandably confuse the two. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a website for hosting projects that _use_ git.

When you edit a file, git can help you determine exactly _what_ changed, _who_ changed it, and _why_.

It’s useful for coordinating work among multiple people on a project, and for tracking progress over time by saving “checkpoints”. You could use it while writing an essay, or to track changes to artwork and design files.

**New to Github?**
Please spend some time and read [this](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). It will be difficult to contribute without some understanding of git.

## Submitting Your Code

DO NOT submit code as zip files. All changes need to be version controlled using Github. All code should be submitted as a Pull Request on Github and checked off by a repository maintainer.

### Step 1: Create a Pull Request

### Step 2: Request a Review

### Step 3: Merge your changes

## Next steps

Request a review from the stakeholders of the project.
